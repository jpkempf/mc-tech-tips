And by "your browser" I mean "Chrome", because apparently that's the only browser that currently has a working implementation of the [Web Bluetooth API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Bluetooth_API). That being said, Rik's little walkthrough of how you can connect to and read data from just about any Bluetooth device—presented using his BBQ temperature sensor as an example—is pretty cool. I even learned about [DataView](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/DataView) as an added bonus!
