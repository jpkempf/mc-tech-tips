This post, titled "[git rebase: what can go wrong?](https://jvns.ca/blog/2023/11/06/rebasing-what-can-go-wrong-/)" by Julia Evans is great and mirrors many of my own feelings on the topic. It's a shame that more people don't see the light and embrace rebase, but it turns out that most people just don't really care very much about their git history. And many of the concerns raised are valid, of course; I just feel that you can work around most of them quite easily by understanding the tool and being diligent, which in my opinion is a good approach for almost anything anyway.
