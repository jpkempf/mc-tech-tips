[npmgraph.js.org](https://npmgraph.js.org/) lets you search for npm packages and view their dependency graph. It can also parse whole `package.json` files and turn those into larger graphs of the same kind. It's interesting, if somewhat unsettling, to see how many dependencies your app hasâ€”and how many of those are being maintained by a single person. It's a lot more than you'd expect, which brings to mind [this xkcd classic](https://xkcd.com/2347/).
