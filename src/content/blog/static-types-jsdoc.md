[Alex Harri writes about JSDoc](https://alexharri.com/blog/jsdoc-as-an-alternative-typescript-syntax) and how you can use it to achieve many of the same things that you would otherwise do with Typescript. I don’t know who needs this, but it's a really comprehensive article and you can do a lot more things than I knew was possible. If for some reason you can’t use proper TS syntax on your project but you still want to enforce static types somehow, this might be for you!
