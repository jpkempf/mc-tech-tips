It doesn't seem to be based on [View Transitions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transitions_API) (yet), but [Barba.js](https://barba.js.org/) seems nice. Not surprisingly, their own page is bursting with examples. Looks really neat but I find myself wishing for faster transitions after a couple of clicks.

Barba isn't the only cool kid on this blockâ€”there's also [swup](https://github.com/swup), for instance, which even has it's own [Astro plugin](https://github.com/swup/astro).

And of course you can achieve most of this manually yourself if you build on top of view transitions, but it's likely more work, at least until libraries like these catch up and start building on top of the still very new native API.
