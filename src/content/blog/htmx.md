So [HTMX](https://htmx.org/) looks pretty cool. It reminds me a lot of [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/), although I'm sure there are differences, and not just in the syntax. It seems useful if you want to add small pieces of functionality to an otherwise static site, without having to pull in a whole framework. Might be very useful in combination with a framework like Astro, although I wonder if the magic behind that wouldn't already give you kind of the same thing while using normal React, Vue, Svelte or whatever components.

Here's [a cool video that gives you an idea about the potential of HTMX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuGyH5RvfbY), and also shows off some nice Astro patterns at the same time.

Only downside is that I'm 100% guaranteed to mistype the name of the tool every single time. Typing `HTML` is burned into my muscle memory too deeply for me to unlearn.

Also, who builds static pages anymore these days? Certainly not me. Sigh. I miss the good old days sometimes.
