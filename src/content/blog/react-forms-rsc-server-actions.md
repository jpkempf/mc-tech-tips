Here's Robin Wieruch on [how to submit and validate forms in Next.js with React Server Components and Server Actions](https://www.robinwieruch.de/next-forms/).

It’s an extensive and well-written post, but I can't help but feel that this whole thing has gotten ridiculously out of hand. I can’t believe how much code is necessary these days just to reproduce the same functionality we used to get out of the box in the olden days with boring old HTML, a simple `<form>`, a page reload and a SSR’d response. And I'm less and less convinced that what we have today is really so much better, neither for the user nor for us as developers.
