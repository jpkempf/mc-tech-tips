This site was created with [Astro](https://astro.build/). I used this command to bootstrap the whole thing:

```bash
npm create astro@latest
```

During the setup process, I selected the "blog template" option, which gives you a basic layout and neat things like MDX and code block support out of the box.

I then deleted a bunch of example content, adjusted the styling, edited some of the layout components and added my own content.

Lastly, I followed [this guide](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/deploy/github/) to set up automatic deploys with GitHub pages.

And that's it!
